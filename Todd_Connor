First of all I want to see myself as a comeptent coder and beyond that as I look at the
keybaord i want to see myself as a compotent typer. But buond that the narrow vision as Todd put
I want to ne at a smaller company with something to do in food maybe Pared? But after reading their
 mission statement along with there website I wonder if they're still way to new to be taking on
 a Ruby Newbie. Maybe after I am up there they will be too and a small company still looking to breed
new talent, enough that I could actually prove to be an asset or they could give my a lot of
potential as well.
I mean If I could work my way up in a company that was just starting off. why would I not take
the option. I could start out directly with them and then move from there while I progress.
But Todd did bring up a good part about this field and my obseeesion with changing obeesions
I never stay in one thing or the other for very long so why not think about this as a way to
bounce for a bit and if I find a place then stay. Bu then that is not the idea of this thought
experiment is it. I am not here to do what I always do and bounce around with what ifs and half
starts it is to thuink hard about what I wan to be doing a be Narrow, be specific.
Soo.... Pared
        Or Muchery
        Or One of those farm to box to people places
        doing web dev
Helping start something with food for them and for me that would fit the best. I do have a
love affair with food that is no doubt so taking that love and paasion and tryong to mix it in
with what I have already done in marketing/pr and taking the new skills that I will get after this
and keep learnig beyond that would be the best idea.
