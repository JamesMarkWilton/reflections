When I am thinking of implementation I am looking at it like the implementation of each strcuture and for that I see no comparison what I mainly see is seperate structires that all have a singular
purpose one is used to house one thing and one is used to house the other. But in this I see a fundatmental difference in what they're used to house, Ints are used when you want to talk about a
something with an inherant value. Something that can be taken and operated on but I guess in that case I am looking at it from anpther mind and truthfully you can operate on all types of structures
and items.
Syntax: is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.
Semantics: a part of lanague and logic considerned with meaning. Implication snese and reference
meaning of the words and what their implication is.
My favorite scrutures are Hashs as they have order and realtion to one another. You access inforamtion in a hash by calling on the name of something
and then you are given that information. That is related to that thing that value. the key value pair. As it were. No. If we removed some of the structures we would lose the ease of use for manipulating
data we would have to find another way to represent this data and that would mean that it would be harder to then use that data somewhere else or for someone els to understand that data. We are starting here
so we can understand what the basics of the lanuage is and how it takes in and stores data in order to ten use that data somewhere else. You could use a hash to say friend and then their name as the value
