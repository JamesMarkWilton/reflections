Hello James,
How are you today?
Oh dear now I am talking to myself!

 I know you may be freaked out right now...both by the fact that I am sending you a message from the future and by the fact that
you're currently undertaking a reallt fucking big step in your life. First I would like to inform you that it was the right choice. I know this, by
both knowing you and by experiencing just a small part of what is about to come that it really is a great idea. I know you might be wide-eyed right
and telling yourself that it is of course great but you"re also cynical that maybe you should've considered the options, stayed in the bay or who
knwos what else is going through that head of yours...well I might, but still.

  Ok, now that we have that part out of the way let's get into what you can expect in a few weeks. Or more importantly...what you can expect to know!
I guess this is still realtive. I mean you know a lot of things but what you understand about coding this far it that. There are 6 basic structures
that make the world go around. Nums, Strings, Booleans, Nil, Arrays and Hashs. And how these things interact in order to store data and let it be
manipulated is basically the world of coding. No matter what you are doing in the world of coding you are basically interacting with these things
in some way. You also know that programming is just storing and manipulating data. Store it somewhere then make it do something. You also know that
all programming follows these guidelines. Ruby has other structures called Objects, Classes and Bindings which are made up of those other structures
and they can then do stuff in Ruby and with data to make Magic Happen!

  Another big thing beyond the basics of code and the world of programming that you have learned is the idea that learning is not just this world of
stare at some txt book and then soak all that info into your noggin and say ok now that I have all that info in there somewhere lest search it down
and then make it happen. It is a world of skills "Hard and Soft" that interact and make up what you call "Smart" you can hone these hard skills and you
should keep trying to hone them so that you can have more time for the fun stuff namely the Soft skills the crazy Logic problems and problemsolving that
you love so much. That other way may help you...no really you brain dumped most of the stuff from the pre-work because you thought of it just like that
'work' and didn't break it down to ok what can I improve on by looking at it as a skill to be gradually increased and one to be scuplted. I will use my
typing as an example I am slowly getting faster and faster and I have to look at the keys less and less to find where to go next and get to think about
what I want to say and how to make this not sound like I am preaching.

  Either way like I said it was totally worth it so stop stressing and just enjoy the experinece. I will see you soon and maybe with this little tid-bit
you will be even smarter then I am right now! TTFN!
