                              ====== Tip 10 =======

  I agree with this idea that you never stop working on a skill that is important to your
these are the things that help you to focus more on the meat of the problem. When you no longer have
to think actively, what key aam I pressing so I can type out these words, or how do I move this block
of code around in vim. You can use that time to worry about how can I better deal with this problem in front of me.
What is it that I can do to make this method really work! And these are things that even though you do them everyday
you can still lose the snappy ability. It is important to stay focussed on way these things are so important. So
by stepping back and doing it once a day you make that idea of these are the down and dirty of the work that I am doing
that much more important.
