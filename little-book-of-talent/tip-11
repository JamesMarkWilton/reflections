I think this touches on a big part of why I am such a procrastinator. I will try something new
and then when I do not instantly get it I get frustrated and stop or push of practicing back
to the "oh I will do it one day folder (directory)" but this is something that I know will
be done truthfully and then I have a basic understanding about like 400,000 things. I also like
the fact that this is brought up in the idea of pre-determined talent. I have always found this
be a very frustrating thing. I mean who is trully that gifted when they are poped out of the
womb. Skills are skills are skills, they can be renforced and learned over time w/ diligence
they're not just given to you through a hand of big old magical one upstairs. It takes work and
work I can do. Ok, off my soap-box. The idea of this falls in line with what we talked about today
in class, The definition of what the "Mindset of a Learner" is where you can break things down into
a science. The process of learning, find what you know and figure out what you don't know
there is always something you don't know.
