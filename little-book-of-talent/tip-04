I agree, I have thought about this before in other classes and when I found out that I had been
accepted to Code Platoon I wondered about this same thing. The idea that I came up with was to
take "the notebook" archetype and from that make a Twitter account that I updated everyday. This
not only gives me the chance to reflect on a daily basis on what I had learned but it also gives
others the chance to see my progress as I go through the school and give them an idea as to what
a coding bootcamp means. I feel that this concept is still a little forgeign in peopl's minds. I
need the renforcement in my mind and others need the view into a world that they maybe don't
understand so all and all it is a win win and what is better then that.
