* It holds the urls that fall under api
* at github
* it is a secure server
* it holds things like search tools
* teams, emails addresses, users, events, emojis, followers
* social media?
* api is defined as a "application program interface" these are used w/ GUI to interact w/ user
* To add more data you would give it a "describer" title block "title":
    and seperate via a colon then the "link" ended with a comma
* they were links to github**** duh
* through these links you can check out git hub and it's function
* another link that would work would be curl 'https://api.github.com/users/JoshCheek'
